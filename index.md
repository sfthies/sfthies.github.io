## Welcome to my personal website

I am a first year PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia University. On this website you can learn about my research interests, ongoing work, and other stuff that I find interesting. This website site is 100% work in progress. Whenever I find some time, I try to work on it and understand how github pages work. 

Stephan holds a BSc in Economics from Freie Universität Berlin (Germany), an MSc in Statistics from Imperial College London (UK), and an MA in International Trade, Finance, and Development from Barcelona Graduate School of Economics (Spain). Prior to joining Columbia’s PhD program, he worked as a research assistant at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and as a consultant for the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sfthies/sfthies.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sfthies/sfthies.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
