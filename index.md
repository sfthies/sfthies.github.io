## Stephan Thies

I am a rising fourth-year PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia University. My current research interests revolve around the intersection of spatial, urban, and environmental economics. You can contact me [here](mailto:stephan.thies@columbia.edu). 

Prior to joining Columbia’s PhD program, I worked as a research assistant at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and as a consultant for the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. I hold a BSc in Economics from Freie Universität Berlin (Germany), an MSc in Statistics from Imperial College London (UK), and an MA in International Trade, Finance, and Development from the Barcelona School of Economics (Spain).
